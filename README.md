# Teacherest - like Pinterest, but for educators
=========

Teacherest is a multi-page app with single page app features. From the main page, a user can search through all resources by category or keyword to see their search results loaded on the same page. 

Click on a resource to view it on a new page. Users can favourite the post and add it to their saved resources, or join the conversation and comment.

Users can view their saved resources on the My Resources page, and update their profile on the My Profile page.
